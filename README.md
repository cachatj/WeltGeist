# Timeline Explorer: Infinite Canvas for Historical Relationships
Timeline Explorer is a sophisticated web application that employs an infinite canvas to visualize multiple parallel timelines representing different domains of knowledge, events, or information. Built with React, TypeScript, and ReactFlow for the frontend, this application enables users to explore correlations and causal relationships across disciplines by connecting events with positive (strengthening) or negative (weakening) relationships. The system uses Next.js for server-side rendering, Zustand for state management, and integrates with Google Cloud Platform through BigQuery for data storage and Cloud Functions for serverless computation. This architecture allows for a clean, responsive interface that can handle complex timeline visualizations while maintaining performance, even with large datasets. The application enables researchers, analysts, and curious minds to discover cross-disciplinary insights by visually mapping the interconnections between events across different domains of knowledge.

## Getting Started
`npm install` to install dependencies
`npm start` to start the development server.

## Frontend Architecture
For a clean, responsive interface with an infinite canvas foundation:

### React.js with TypeScript for the core application
Strong typing will help manage complex timeline relationships
Component-based architecture fits well with your timeline visualization needs

### Zustand for state management
Lightweight yet powerful for managing complex application state
Better performance than Redux for canvas-heavy applications

### React Flow or ReactFlow.js for the infinite canvas implementation
Specifically designed for node-based interfaces with connections
Built-in panning, zooming, and connection capabilities

### D3.js for advanced timeline visualizations
Can be integrated with React for custom timeline rendering

### TailwindCSS for styling
Allows for rapid UI development with consistent design patterns


## Backend Architecture
For GCP integration and high performance:

### Next.js with API routes for the backend framework
Server-side rendering for better performance
Built-in API routes for communication with the database

### Google Cloud Functions for serverless backend logic
Handles data processing and complex queries
Easily scales with usage

### BigQuery for data storage as specified
Direct integration with other GCP services
Excellent for analytical queries across large datasets

### Firebase Authentication for user management
Seamless integration with GCP
Handles authentication securely

### Google Cloud Storage for static assets
Fast delivery of application assets
